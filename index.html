    Mini Games:
    SkyWars - There is an island and you need to kill your opponent.
    BedWars - Like SkyWars but with islands, but you need to protect your bed on it and destroy the opponent&#x27;s bed.
    SkyBlock - You appear on an island in the sky, all you have is a couple of trees and a cave portal. You need to develop and build your island in the sky. Create from nothing a whole paradise in the sky, dangerous farm, shop or just a cozy house!
    OneBlock - You appear on an island in the sky. You need mine central block to get new random blocks. Try to build a house from random mined resources!
    Hide &amp; Seek - You look like a block for a seeker. You need to hide yourself in other blocks and don&#x27;t let the seeker find you.
    Capture the Point - You need to capture and hold all points and earn a score to win the game.
    Zombies - You need to survive as many zombie waves as you can. Each wave of zombies becomes more powerful.
    AmongUs - Like a real Among Us game, complete tasks with crewmates and find impostors.
    Duels - Just a duel with 2 or 4 players, it is available in Creative and Survival modes.
    DeathMatch - Infinite battle with instant shooting crossbows, show who is boss here!
    Spleef - Like in the good old times, where this game was on every Minecraft server. You need to dig a block of sand under your opponent and let him fall.
    Maze - You need to find a path to exit a maze.
    
    Different game modes:
    Creative - You can do anything in your world. You have infinite resources and you are invisible. You can place any block, spawn any mob and use any command.
    Survival PvE - You need to survive against hostile mobs, eat food and craft armor and enchant your gear to protect yourself from death.
    Survival PvP - The same as PvE but you need to protect yourself from other players too.
    
    Many Biomes:
    Overworld - Public world for all players with a safe zone at the center.
    Nether - Be careful, it&#x27;s too hot and dangerous.
    End - The world with the boss - Ender Dragon. Beat the boss to unlock the portal to End City and elytra.
    Cave - Here you need to mine ores and find chests with rare loot.
    Dungeon - The same as a cave but with bosses, be careful they are too powerful.
    Other worlds: Swamp, Forest, Desert
    Dungeon Bosses:
    The game has some bosses, they are extremely powerful and can kill players with poor armor with oneshot. To kill that boss you need to cooperate with other players or just be a skilled player. The boss has good loot, auto regeneration and small minions to help kill you.
    
    Shops:
    You can build your own shop or use a default shop made by developers. To gain new visitors you can feature your world, clickbait world name, drop portal near players, etc.
    
    Friends:
    You can make connections and add friends to your friend list. It will help you find who is online and make teleport requests.
    
    Teleport Requests:
    You can request a teleport to any online player using the Players button at the top left corner. If the player accepts the request, you will be instantly teleported to him.
    
    Auctions:
    You can buy or sell worlds and items at the auction, the auction helps you find a fair price for a world or item. Players bid and outbid, each new bid raises the price, leaving only one player willing to pay for a world or item.
    
    Regeneration of resources:
    Resources are regenerating within 15 minutes.
    Your items are deleted and worlds auctioned after 6 months of inactivity in the game.
    
    Staff:
    There is a special player called stuff. They can be moderators, developers, helpers etc
